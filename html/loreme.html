                    <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                    of
                    type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
                    also
                    the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
                    1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                    desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                    their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                    their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                    purpose (injected humour and the like).

                <td colspan="2">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
                    piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                    literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
                    of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
                    book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
                    Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</td>
                <td>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                    alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                    believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                    anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet
                    tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                    It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
                    to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
                    from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</td>

                            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
                            bound to ensue; and equal <br>
                            blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
                            through shrinking from toil <br>
                            and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power
                            of choice is untrammelled and <br>
                            when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                            every pain avoided. But in <br>
                            certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
                            frequently occur that pleasures have <br>
                            to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to
                            this principle of selection: he <br>
                            rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
